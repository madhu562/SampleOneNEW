# Website-Project

In this project. I made a website template using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. 

To build the index page I envisioned it in a responsive yet simple structure.
Adding meta data for SEO purposes to enhance effective web searches for
it to appear on search engines. While linking the awesome CSS3 stylesheet
that I created to make it look epic with a magic touch of simplicity.

Now for the fun part. Writing down the div tags for every function. 

Indenting is highly important for every rising developer especially for the
sakes of humans reading the code when they view page source it on their
browsers.

Unordered lists, h1 headers, sections plus IDs, a form, img tags, h3 tags and 
a hefty footer to complete the masterpiece.

For the rest of the pages it was a glorious copy & paste for 'About' and 'Services'.
These were tweaked a bit to be on par with their own header titles.

Finally, let's talk about my main.css stylesheet which is gloriously epic indeed.
Padding each margin to fit the web page, painting the header & backgrounds, leveling
up the button structures, and most importantly inserting the @media (max-width:768px)
device display code for width page adjustments for tablet & phone devices.

Read my code to understand how it was made. 

Download it as a .zip folder and run it on a text editor.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Christian
